# Sloth: CQRS Opinionated API Framework

## Introduction

**Sloth** is an opinionated framework designed to simplify the development of
API services. Built on top of popular JavaScript and Deno web frameworks, it
provides a structured and scalable approach to API design.

Inspired by years of hands-on experience building APIs across various
programming languages, **Sloth** empowers developers to focus on functionality
while adhering to the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern.
