# Sloth: An Opinionated API Framework

## Introduction

**Sloth** is an opinionated framework for building API services using existing
and popular JavaScript/Deno web frameworks.

This project serves as a head start for organizing your code and scaling your
application. It is the result of years of experience building APIs across
various programming languages.

## Getting Started

To see an example implementation, check the `examples/oak` directory. This
codebase demonstrates how to implement an API service using **Sloth**.

## Disclaimer

⚠️ **Warning:** This project is still under active development. Interfaces and
object contracts are subject to change. A stable `1.0` release will be published
once the project is validated and stabilized.
