# Sloth Express

This is the reference implementation of API service which may assist you to
understand the Sloth project. Look at the source code; it is kept simple to help
newcomers to adopt Sloth easily

You may also want to copy this code to get started. There are some comments on
internals of the Sloth along the implementation; so may help you to understand
what is going on under the hood.

Don't forget that the intent of this project is not to rewrite the `express`.
The framework is amazing and there is no need to hide you from the details. What
we want to accomplish here is to give you little help and push things forward so
you have a better way to structure the API code.

## Getting Started

All you need to do is to execute the `deno run -A src/main.ts` command using
your terminal / shell.

You can run this project executing the `sh ./dev.sh` or `sh ./test.sh` scripts.
